# Predicting hospital readmission
In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict 30-day unplanned hospital readmission using discharge summaries

# Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to get access to the MIMICIII database, a freely available hospital database. 
You can request access at https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

You will need to download the ADMISSIONS and NOTEEVENTS tables into this project's folder.
